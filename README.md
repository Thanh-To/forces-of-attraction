### Project-Wide
- Built skeleton structure based off of previous programming assignment boilerplate (1 hr)

### Force-Directed Graph
- Basic structure based on [this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/UBC-InfoVis/2021-436V-examples/tree/master/d3-force-directed-graph?file=/css/style.css:212-236) from the Advanced Concepts tutorial.
- Learned how to update the force-simulation from [Modifying a Force-Directed Graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/modifying-a-force-directed-graph) by Mike Bostock.
- Learned how to make nodes draggable in [this notebook](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph).
- Used [this case study](https://github.com/UBC-InfoVis/2021-436V-case-studies/blob/097d13b05d587f4fab3e3fcd23f5e99274397c2c/case-study_measles-and-vaccines/css/style.css) for tooltip style and techniques.
